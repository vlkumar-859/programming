### 1. Maximum SubArray Sum (Kadane's alogrithm) :
   [leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
   #### Approach :
   1. iterate through the array and keep track of variable sum.
   2. if on adding the curr element to the sum , if the sum greater than max update the max
   3. if sum is less than 0 , then make sum to 0
   4. finally return the max
   ```js
   Time Complexity : O(n)
   Space Complexity : O(1)
   ```
