### 1. Set Matrix Zeroes :   
   [leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)
   #### Approach :
   if there is 0 in 0th column or row make a note if it.
   Change the first element of it's row and column to zero , and then traversing change all the elements in that row and column to 0's if the first row/column is 0. 
   ```js
   Time Complexity : O(m*n)
   Space Complexity : O(1)

### 2. Pascal's Triangle :
   [leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)
   #### Approach :
   initialise 1st row with 1
   initialise 1st and ith element of the ith row by 1.
   Create a new row using the previous row by adding the ith and i-1th element to get the ith element value in new row.
   ```js
   Time Complexity : O(n*n)
   Space Complexity : O(n*n)

### 3. Next Permutation :
 [leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)
 ### Approach :
 #### Brute Force:
 Find all the permutations and keep them in a sorted array , and then return the result based on that array.
 ```js
   Time Complexity : O(n*n!)
   Space Complexity : O(n)
  ````
 #### Optimal Solution :
 1.Traverse from the back and find the break even point , which means to find the first element which is smaller than the next element (ith element < i+1th element)
 2. Find the smallest element right to the ith element which is greater than the ith element.
 3. Swap ith element and that element.
 4. Sort the elements right to the ith element.
 return the number.
 ```js
   Time Complexity : O(n)
   Space Complexity : O(1)
