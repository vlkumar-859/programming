### 1. Set Matrix Zeroes 
### 2. Pascal's Triangle


### 1. Set Matrix Zeroes :    

   [leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)
   #### Approach :
   if there is 0 in 0th column or row make a note if it.
   Change the first element of it's row and column to zero , and then traversing change all the elements in that row and column to 0's if the first row/column is 0. 
   ```js
   Time Complexity : O(m*n)
   Space Complexity : O(1)

### 2. Pascal's Triangle :

   [leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)
   #### Approach :
   initialise 1st row with 1
   initialise 1st and ith element of the ith row by 1.
   Create a new row using the previous row by adding the ith and i-1th element to get the ith element value in new row.
   ```js
   Time Complexity : O(n*n)
   Space Complexity : O(n*n)
