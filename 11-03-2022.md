   ### Approach :
   This can be solved using recursion as the brute force approach , for bigger arrays or lists time limit will be exceeded.
   Optimised solution is to use dynamic programming (bottom up) approach.
   ```
   def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp=[1]*len(nums)
        m=1
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i]>nums[j]:
                    dp[i]=max(dp[i],dp[j]+1)
            if m<dp[i]:
                m=dp[i]       
        return m
   ```
    
   ```js
   Time Complexity : O(n*n)
   Space Complexity : O(n)
