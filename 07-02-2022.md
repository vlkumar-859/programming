# 01. Insertion Sort -> Inserting at correct position in left
# 02. Selection Sort -> Selecting minimum element from right

---
# 01. Insertion Sort

  ### Algorithm :
  1. Dvivide the array into 2 parts. left one is sorted array and right is unsorted array.
  2. Pick the value from the unsorted array one by one , and place that element in the correct position in the sorted array.
  ```js
  Time Complexity : Worst Case -> O(n^2) , Best Case -> O(n)
  Space Complexity : O(1)
  ```

  ### Code :
  ```js
  
  # Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort

  # Function to do insertion sort
  def insertionSort(arr):

      # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
      for i in range(1, len(arr)):

          key = arr[i]

          # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
          # greater than key, to one position ahead
          # of their current position
          j = i-1
          while j >= 0 and key < arr[j] :
                  arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                  j -= 1
          arr[j + 1] = key
 
  # Driver code to test above
  arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
  insertionSort(arr)
  for i in range(len(arr)):
      print ("% d" % arr[i])
  ```

# 02. Selection Sort

  ### Algorithm :
  1. Divide the array into 2 parts , sorted and unsorted array.
  2. Pick the minimum element from the right part.
  3. Swap the elements in current element index and minimum element index, if minimum element from right part is smaller than the current element.
  ```js
  Time Complexity : Worst Case -> O(n^2) , Best Case -> O(n^2)
  Space Complexity : O(1)
  ```

  ### Code :
  ```js
  # Python program for implementation of Selection
  # Sort
  import sys
  A = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

  # Traverse through all array elements
  for i in range(len(A)):

    # Find the minimum element in remaining
    # unsorted array
    min_idx = i
    for j in range(i+1, len(A)):
      if A[min_idx] > A[j]:
        min_idx = j

    # Swap the found minimum element with
    # the first element		
    A[i], A[min_idx] = A[min_idx], A[i]

  # Driver code to test above
  print ("Sorted array")
  for i in range(len(A)):
    print("%d" %A[i],end=" ")
