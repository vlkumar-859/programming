# 01. Insertion Sort

  ### Algorithm :
  1. Dvivide the array into 2 parts. left one is sorted array and right is unsorted array.
  2. Pick the value from the unsorted array one by one , and place that element in the correct position in the sorted array.
  ```js
  Time Complexity : Worst Case -> O(n^2) , Best Case -> O(n)
  Space Complexity : O(n)
  ```

  ### Code :
  ```
  
  # Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort

  # Function to do insertion sort
  def insertionSort(arr):

      # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
      for i in range(1, len(arr)):

          key = arr[i]

          # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
          # greater than key, to one position ahead
          # of their current position
          j = i-1
          while j >= 0 and key < arr[j] :
                  arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                  j -= 1
          arr[j + 1] = key
 
  # Driver code to test above
  arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
  insertionSort(arr)
  for i in range(len(arr)):
      print ("% d" % arr[i])
  ```
